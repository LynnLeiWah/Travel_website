    <p> Naypyidaw is the capital city of Myanmar.
        <br> It was built in 2005 and is known for its wide streets and modern government buildings.
        <br> The city is much larger than most other cities in Myanmar but has fewer people.
        <br> Notable places include the Uppatasanti Pagoda, which resembles the Shwedagon Pagoda, and the National Museum. Naypyidaw was designed to be a planned city with specific zones for government, hotels, and shopping.</p>
